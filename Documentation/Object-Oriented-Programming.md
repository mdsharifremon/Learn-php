## Object Oriented Programming

The basic and first principle of oop is DRY.<br> 
D = Don't 
R = Repeat
Y = Yourself

Basics Concepts of OOP :<br> 
__Abstraction__ : Hide your data from others.

__Encapsulation__ : Holding things together under a roof.

__Inheritance__ : Inherit or extends some something from one class to another class in Inheritance.

__Polymorphism__ : One function return various result depends on its object and where it is called.

__Constructor__ : __construct () this function is called by itself automatically. It may have args.

__Destructor__ : __destruct () this function is used to destroy a object. It will run end of the script.

__Static__: static keyword is used to define a property or a method static. A static method or property is Associated with class not with the instance or object. It can not provide value of this. And Static method or property can ber accessed from outside of a class without creating a instance or object.<br>
 When a static method or property is called inside of its class  use self::<br>
 When a static method or property is called from its derived class use parent::<br> 
 When a static method or property is need to be override use static::<br>

    * Instance 
    * DRY - Principle
    * Inheritance - extends
    * Abstraction - abstract
    * Interface - interface & implements
